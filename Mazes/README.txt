When run is hit, it will begin with a DFS on the starting maze
	-as for all new mazes, this will begin with the maze construction 


To pause the search or building
	-hit space
	-Note: No other key events can unpause the search or building
		-you will need to unpause with space regardless of other key events


To start a new search on the same maze
	-hit "b" for BFS
	-hit "p" for DFS
	-hit "m" for Manual gameplay
	-Note: selecting any of these will clear all seen paths so far

For moving in the square maze during a manual game
	-use arrow keys

To skip over the construction phase
	-hit shift and 1 (otherwise known as "!")
	

For creating a new maze
	-hit "r" for a maze with horizontal bias (rows)
	-hit "c" for a maze with a vertical bias (columns)
	-hit "n" for a new maze without bias
	
	
For looking at each cell's distance from a certain point as a color scale
	-hit "k" for the distance from the starting cell
	-hit "l" for the distance from the finish cell
	

For toggling the viewing of already seen cells
	-hit "-"
	
For toggling hexagonal mazes
	-hit "q"
	
For moving in a manual hexagonal maze
	-hit "w" to move top left
	-hit "e" to move top right
	-hit "a" to move left
	-hit "d" to move right
	-hit "z" to move bottom left
	-hit "x" to move bottom right
